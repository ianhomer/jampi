Sequencer on a Raspberry Pi

WARNING : This project is in a phase of early prototype exploration.  If you 
want to explore then please continue.  If you want a painless experience, best 
to  wait until I've carved a way through the jungle.

# Manual Steps

I'll be scripting up these steps ... but for the time being as I put this
prototype together I'm recording the manual steps

## Which Pi to Buy

I bought the following from https://shop.pimoroni.com/

* Raspberry Pi 3 Essentials Kit 
* Unicorn HAT HD
* USB Audio Input/Output Dongle
* Ninja diffuser

I'm sure many other combinations, suppliers will work fine.

## Initialise Pi with

See _tools/pi.md for guidance on how to get started with a raspberry pi.

## Install Sequencer

Installation of https://github.com/ianhomer/odin ... note that this
is work in progress.  I tested a prototype a while ago, but need to do 
more work to get the sequencer working well on the pi.  One day soon.
